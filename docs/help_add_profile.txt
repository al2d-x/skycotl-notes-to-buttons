How to Add a Profile

Profiles live in the “sntb-ui” folder. Each profile is a subfolder that contains
numbered icon images 1.png through 15.png.

Steps:
 1) Open Help → Open profiles folder.
 2) Create a new subfolder; the folder name becomes the profile name shown in the app.
 3) Put your numbered images inside:
       1.png  …  15.png
    From Ingame: Top-left is 1, bottom-right is 15.
 5) Restart the app so it discovers your new profile.

Tips:
 • Copy an existing profile and replace the images as a starting point.
 • Use Help → Validate selected profile to see if any icons are missing or out of range.
 • Attribution: If you use third-party icons, make sure you comply with their license.
   See Help → Licenses for examples.
