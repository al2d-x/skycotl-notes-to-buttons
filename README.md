# Sky: Notes ‚Üí Buttons

Turn a song you downloaded from **Sky Music** into a clean, easy-to-read **button chart** for an Xbox controller.  
You give the app an **HTML file** from <https://sky-music.github.io/>, it reads the notes, and it exports an HTML page that shows, bar by bar, **which buttons to press** (A, B, X, Y, D-pad, LT/RT/LB/RB, sticks) and when to **Rest**.

## FAQ

### ‚ÄúWhy is the download ~40 MB?‚Äù
It‚Äôs a packaged Python app (PyInstaller). It includes the Python runtime and libraries so you don‚Äôt have to install anything. That‚Äôs normal size for a small Python GUI app.

### ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you make it smaller?‚Äù
Maybe later. Shrinking means carefully excluding libraries and testing a lot; easy to break things. Stability first. üôÇ

### ‚ÄúWhy does the UI look simple?‚Äù
Because function > fashion. I‚Äôm a backend person. The UI is intentionally minimal so it‚Äôs fast and clear.

### ‚ÄúWhy only Xbox buttons?‚Äù
The first version targets the Xbox layout. Because i have an xbox controller. I might add other layouts later.  
If you are adventurous, you can **replace the PNG images** in the `ui/` folder with your own, but **keep the same file names** (e.g., `A.png`, `LT.png`).

### ‚ÄúIt looks too small / too big.‚Äù
Use **CTRL + Mouse Wheel** or **CTRL + + / ‚àí** in your browser.

## Notes & Tips

- The app looks for the notes under a special section in the HTML (`<div id="transcript">`). If the file is not from the Sky Music site or it‚Äôs edited, it may not parse.
- If a bar has no notes, you'll see **‚ÄúRest‚Äù** in that bar.
- Works offline once you have the HTML file.
